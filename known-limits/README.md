This directory contains a list of the known quota limits we hit on various clouds.
It is not ideal to track like this, but it is expedient for helping us get the third accounts
open on various platforms.
We didn't track it on the first accounts, we can track it on the second accounts, we can
reuse the known values on the third account.
